# Print and None

## Pure & Non-Pure Functions

Pure: just return values
Non-Pure: have side effects

## Statements

A statenment is executed by the interpreter to perform an action 

The first header determines a statement's type; The header of a clause "controls" the suite that follows; def statements are compound statements

### Compoud statements

A suite is a sequence of statements; To "execute" a suite means to execute its sequence of statements, in order. 

## Designing functions

- Give each function exactly one job
- Don't repeat yourself (DRY)
- Define functions generally
