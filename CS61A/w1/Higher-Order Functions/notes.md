## Purpose
Functions are first-class: Functions can be manipulated as values in our programming language. 

Higher-order function: A function that takes a function as an argument value or returns a function as a return value

- Express general methods of computation
- Remove repetition from prgorams
-Separate concerns among funcitons

## Currying
Transforming a multi-argument function into a single-argument, high-order funciton
