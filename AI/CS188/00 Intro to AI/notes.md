# What is AI?

The science of making machines that: Think rationally, Think like people, Act like people, Act rationally(optimally)

Better called Computational Rationality - Maximize Your Expected Utility

# What about Brain?
Lessons learned: memory(data) and simulation(computation) are key to decision making

Brains are to intelligence as wings are to flight

# Course Topics
- __Intelligence from Computation__:  
About algorithms that through computation, take a situation and figure out something smart to do

- __Intelligence form Data__:  
ML

- __Throughout Applications__:

# Design Rational Agent
An agent is an entity that perceives and acts.  
A rational agent selects actions that maximize its (expected) utility.  
Characteristics of the percepts, environment, and action space dictate techniques for selecting rational actions
